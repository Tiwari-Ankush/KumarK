loops in java:

1. For Loop:
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run.

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
}


2.While Loop:
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a certain condition is true.

int count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Iteration " + count);
    count++;
}
