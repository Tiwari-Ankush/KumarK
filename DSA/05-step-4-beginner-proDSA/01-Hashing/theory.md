## What is Hashing.
*Hashing is basically used to store details and information of a data structure(say array) in an efficient way which helps to solve a problem efficiently.*
- **Hashing**: Process of converting input data into a fixed-size string of characters (hash code).
- **Purpose**: Quickly locate data records or values in databases or hash tables.
- **Hash Function**: Algorithm that generates the hash code, designed to be fast and efficient.
- **Unique Output**: Hash functions aim to produce a unique or nearly unique output for different inputs.
- **Indexing**: Hash code serves as an index or address for efficient data retrieval.
- **Applications**: Widely used in data storage, cryptography, and indexing structures.
- **Efficiency**: Hashing provides a faster alternative to linear search by reducing search time complexity.
- **Collision**: Occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash code, requiring collision resolution strategies.
- **Security**: Hash functions play a crucial role in password hashing and digital signatures in cybersecurity.
