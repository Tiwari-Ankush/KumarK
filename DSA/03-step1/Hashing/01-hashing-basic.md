what is hashing actually?

what are hashSet and hashMap with example?

what is treemap? givewith example.

difference between hashmap and treemap?

what is linear search and its complexity?

what is binary search and its complexity?

what is hash function and hashtable

complexity of hashing technique?

what are one to one and many to one function in hashing.

Tell me what exactly collision resolution methods are:
>> Open hashing
  >> Chaining
>> Closed hashing
  >> Open addressing
    >> 1. Linear Probing
    >> 2. Quadratic Probing


what are the hash functions for linear probing and quadratic probing.
