Rules:
1. *When we have polynomial type of thing so while finding a time complexity then we will always ignore the lowest order variable term.*

2. *We will also ignore the constants*
    _that means: if **[((n^2)/2)+(n/2)]** in this order of polynomial is 2, lowest order variable is **(n/2)** so we neglect it and after removing constant also, we got **n^2** as a complexity._
