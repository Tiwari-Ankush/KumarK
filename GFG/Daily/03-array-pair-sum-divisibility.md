problem:
Given an array of integers nums and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

Example 1 :

Input : 
nums = [9, 5, 7, 3]
k = 6
Output: 
True
Explanation: 
{(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a 
possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.
Example 2:

Input : 
nums = [4, 4, 4]
k = 4
Output: 
False
Explanation: 
You can make 1 pair at max, leaving a single 4 unpaired.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canPair() which takes array nums and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.

solution:

```
public class Solution {
    public static boolean canPair(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length % 2 != 0) {
            return false; // Array length should be even for pairs
        }

        int[] remainderCount = new int[k];

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            int remainder = (num % k + k) % k; // Handle negative numbers
            remainderCount[remainder]++;
        }

        if (remainderCount[0] % 2 != 0) {
            return false; // There should be an even number of multiples of k
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= k / 2; i++) {
            if (remainderCount[i] != remainderCount[k - i]) {
                return false; // Pairs with complementary remainders are required
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}

```


explanation:
The problem is asking to determine whether it's possible to divide the given array into pairs such that the sum of every pair is divisible by the given number `k`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. You are given an array of integers `nums` and a number `k`.
2. You need to check if it's possible to divide the array into pairs such that the sum of every pair is divisible by `k`.
3. If there exists a pair `(nums[i], nums[j])` such that `(nums[i] + nums[j]) % k == 0`, then it's possible.
4. If all pairs have a sum that is divisible by `k`, return `true`.
5. If there's at least one pair whose sum is not divisible by `k`, return `false`.

The goal is to determine if there's a way to pair up the elements in the array such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

Your task is to complete the function `canPair()` that takes the array `nums` and the integer `k` as input parameters and returns `true` if the array can be divided into pairs satisfying the condition, otherwise `false`.
