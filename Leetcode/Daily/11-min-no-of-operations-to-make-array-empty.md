problem:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106


soln:

```
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        int s = 0;
        while (s < nums.length) {
            int e = s;
            while (e < nums.length && nums[s] == nums[e]) {
                e++;
            }
            int count = e - s;
            if (count == 1) {
                return -1;
            }
            res += count / 3;
            if (count % 3 != 0) {
                res++;
            }
            s = e;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```



main logic explanation:
Certainly! The problem you described involves minimizing the number of operations to empty an array, given two types of operations:

1. Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
2. Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

Here's a step-by-step logic for the given problem:

1. **Sort the array**: Start by sorting the given array in ascending order.

2. **Count occurrences**: Iterate through the sorted array and count the occurrences of each element. Store this information in a map, where the key is the element, and the value is its count.

3. **Create a new array**: Create a new array to store the results of operations. Iterate through the map entries, and for each element:

   a. If the count of the element is 1, it's not possible to pair or group it with others. Return -1 as it's impossible to empty the array.

   b. If the count is greater than 3 or equal to the element itself, it means you can group them in sets of three or more. In this case, add `count/3` to the result array.

   c. If the count is not a multiple of 3, add 1 to the result array. This is because you need one additional operation to group the remaining elements.

4. **Calculate the sum**: Calculate the sum of the elements in the result array. This sum represents the minimum number of operations required to empty the array.

5. **Return the result**: Return the calculated sum.

The idea is to handle the cases where you can group elements in sets of three or more efficiently, and for the remaining elements, consider one additional operation for each group. If an element occurs only once, it's impossible to pair or group, so you return -1. The goal is to minimize the number of operations needed to empty the array according to the given conditions.
