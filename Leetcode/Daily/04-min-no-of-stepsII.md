problem:You are given two strings s and t. In one step, you can append any character to either s or t.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams of each other.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
Example 2:

Input: s = "night", t = "thing"
Output: 0
Explanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 105
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.





soln:
```
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']--;
        }

        int steps = 0;

        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += Math.abs(count);
        }

        return steps;
    }
}

```


explanation:

Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step, along with explanations and comments:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        // Create an array to store the frequency of each character in the alphabet (a to z)
        int[] frequency = new int[26];

        // Calculate the frequency of characters in string s
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Subtract the frequency of characters in string t
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']--;
        }

        // Initialize the variable to store the total steps needed
        int steps = 0;

        // Iterate through the frequency array to calculate the absolute differences
        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += Math.abs(count);
        }

        // Return the total steps required to make s and t anagrams
        return steps;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - You are given two strings `s` and `t`. In one step, you can append any character to either `s` or `t`.
   - Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other.

2. **Code Explanation:**
   - We use an integer array `frequency` of size 26 to represent the frequency of each character in the alphabet.
   - We iterate through string `s` and increment the corresponding character's frequency in the `frequency` array.
   - We iterate through string `t` and decrement the corresponding character's frequency in the `frequency` array.
   - Now, the `frequency` array represents the difference in the frequency of characters between `s` and `t`.
   - We iterate through the `frequency` array and calculate the absolute differences, adding them to the `steps` variable.
   - The final result in the `steps` variable represents the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams.

3. **Comments:**
   - The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each section and clarify the logic used.

This code follows the given hints and correctly addresses the issue to calculate the minimum steps for making `s` and `t` anagrams.
