problem:You are given two strings s and t. In one step, you can append any character to either s or t.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams of each other.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
Example 2:

Input: s = "night", t = "thing"
Output: 0
Explanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 105
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.





soln:
```
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']--;
        }

        int steps = 0;

        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += Math.abs(count);
        }

        return steps;
    }
}

```


explanation:

Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step, along with explanations and comments:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        // Create an array to store the frequency of each character in the alphabet (a to z)
        int[] frequency = new int[26];

        // Calculate the frequency of characters in string s
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Subtract the frequency of characters in string t
        for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[ch - 'a']--;
        }

        // Initialize the variable to store the total steps needed
        int steps = 0;

        // Iterate through the frequency array to calculate the absolute differences
        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += Math.abs(count);
        }

        // Return the total steps required to make s and t anagrams
        return steps;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - You are given two strings `s` and `t`. In one step, you can append any character to either `s` or `t`.
   - Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other.

2. **Code Explanation:**
   - We use an integer array `frequency` of size 26 to represent the frequency of each character in the alphabet.
   - We iterate through string `s` and increment the corresponding character's frequency in the `frequency` array.
   - We iterate through string `t` and decrement the corresponding character's frequency in the `frequency` array.
   - Now, the `frequency` array represents the difference in the frequency of characters between `s` and `t`.
   - We iterate through the `frequency` array and calculate the absolute differences, adding them to the `steps` variable.
   - The final result in the `steps` variable represents the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams.

3. **Comments:**
   - The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each section and clarify the logic used.

This code follows the given hints and correctly addresses the issue to calculate the minimum steps for making `s` and `t` anagrams.


extra:

Certainly! The part of the code you're asking about is responsible for subtracting the frequency of characters in string `t` from the previously calculated frequencies in the array `frequency`. Let's break it down:

```java
// Subtract the frequency of characters in string t
for (char ch : t.toCharArray()) {
    frequency[ch - 'a']--;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Initially, we calculated the frequency of characters in string `s` and stored it in the `frequency` array.

2. **Subtracting Frequencies of Characters in `t`:**
   - Now, we need to consider the characters in string `t` and their frequencies.
   - For each character `ch` in string `t`, we subtract one from the corresponding position in the `frequency` array.
   - The expression `ch - 'a'` is used to map the character `ch` to its corresponding index in the `frequency` array. For example, if `ch` is 'a', then `ch - 'a'` equals 0, and if `ch` is 'b', then `ch - 'a'` equals 1, and so on.

3. **Purpose:**
   - The purpose of this subtraction is to effectively cancel out the common characters between `s` and `t`. By subtracting the frequencies of characters in `t`, we are left with the difference in frequencies between the two strings.

4. **After This Operation:**
   - After this subtraction loop, the `frequency` array will represent the difference in the frequency of each character between `s` and `t`. Positive values indicate excess characters in `s`, and negative values indicate excess characters in `t`.

5. **Further Steps:**
   - The subsequent part of the code iterates through the `frequency` array to calculate the absolute differences and sums them up. This total represents the minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams.

In summary, this subtraction step ensures that we have the correct count of each character's frequency difference between the two strings, which is essential for calculating the minimum steps.
