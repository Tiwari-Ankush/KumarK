coding is a set of instructions , by that we can achieve the goals

we need a programmming language for this ie binary language  ie 0 and 1

programming language is a way to talk to the computer 

hello world program: in java 
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}


java is a case sensitive language
