In Java, a static initializer block is a block of code enclosed in curly braces {} and defined inside a class, but outside of any method, constructor, or other block. It is executed when the class is loaded by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and it is used to perform one-time initialization tasks for the class.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    // Static variables for breadth and height
    static int B;
    static int H;
    static boolean flag = true;

    // Static initializer block
    static {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        B = scanner.nextInt();
        H = scanner.nextInt();

        // Check if both values are positive
        if (B <= 0 || H <= 0) {
            System.out.println("java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive");
            flag = false;
        }

        // Close the scanner to avoid resource leaks
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check if flag is true before calculating area
        if (flag) {
            int area = B * H;
            System.out.println(area);
        }
    }
}



explanation:

{
    Certainly! Let's go through the code line by line to understand its functionality:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
```

1. Import necessary classes for input/output operations and Scanner.

```java
public class Solution {
    // Static variables for breadth and height
    static int B;
    static int H;
    static boolean flag = true;
```

2. Declare a class named `Solution` with static variables `B` and `H` to store the breadth and height, and a boolean `flag` to indicate whether the values are valid.

```java
    // Static initializer block
    static {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        B = scanner.nextInt();
        H = scanner.nextInt();
```

3. Start a static initializer block. This block is executed when the class is loaded.

4. Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input.

5. Read the values of breadth (`B`) and height (`H`) from the user.

```java
        // Check if both values are positive
        if (B <= 0 || H <= 0) {
            System.out.println("java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive");
            flag = false;
        }
```

6. Check if both breadth and height are positive. If not, print an exception message and set `flag` to `false`.

```java
        // Close the scanner to avoid resource leaks
        scanner.close();
    }
```

7. Close the `Scanner` to avoid resource leaks.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check if flag is true before calculating area
        if (flag) {
            int area = B * H;
            System.out.println(area);
        }
    }
}
```

8. Declare the `main` method.

9. Check if the `flag` is `true` before calculating the area. If `flag` is `false`, it means the inputs were invalid, and the program won't proceed.

10. If the inputs are valid, calculate the area (`B * H`) and print it.

This code uses a static initializer block to read input, check its validity, and then calculate and print the area if the input is valid. The use of the `flag` variable helps control the flow of the program based on the validity of the input.
